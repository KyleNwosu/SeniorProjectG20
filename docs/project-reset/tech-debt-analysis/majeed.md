This document summarizes individual contributions to the team's technical debt and risk analysis for the Amazon Connect Agent Supervisor Insights project.

## TD-03 No Automated Test Suite — Manual Checklist Is the Only QA

**Category:** Test Debt

**Description:**
There is no test framework installed, no test script defined in package.json, and no test files anywhere in the repository. The only verification protocol is a four-item manual checklist in the README that instructs developers to click buttons and watch for toast notifications. All four feature components (RobotStatus, ControlPanel, TaskBuilder, Scheduler) were AI-generated by Lovable.dev and have never been subjected to any automated behavioral assertion. Stateful logic in TaskBuilder (add, remove, update steps) and Scheduler (add, remove, update schedules) has no regression protection.

**Remediation Plan:**
Install vitest and @testing-library/react as dev dependencies and add a "test": "vitest" script to package.json. Write unit tests for TaskBuilder covering add, remove, and update operations. Write unit tests for Scheduler covering the same. Write render tests for RobotStatus and ControlPanel asserting correct labels and button presence. Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs npm test on every push to main to enforce a passing baseline.


## TD-04 No Traceability Between Code and Agile Requirements

**Category:** Documentation Debt

**Description:**
No component, function, or file in the codebase contains a reference to a user story, acceptance criterion, sprint ticket, or backlog item. The action set available in TaskBuilder (move-forward, move-backward, turn-left, turn-right, wait) and the frequency options in Scheduler (daily, weekdays, weekends, once) have no traceable origin — it is unknown whether these represent a complete or partial implementation of any agreed requirement. cursor_migration.md covers only the Lovable.dev tooling removal and contains no functional requirement context. There is no way to answer whether any tab or feature satisfies its acceptance criteria without consulting documents entirely outside the codebase.

**Remediation Plan:**
Add a JSDoc block to each feature component citing the user story it implements (e.g., @story US-03). Create a docs/requirements-traceability.md file that maps each component and feature to its source user story. If stories are tracked in GitHub Issues, link them by ID directly in component comments. For enumerated values like task actions and schedule frequencies, add inline comments citing the requirement that defines the allowed set so future changes are deliberate and traceable.
